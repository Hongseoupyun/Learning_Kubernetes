# Understanding the Kubernetes Deployment YAML File

What is a YAML File?

üìù YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable data format often used for configuration files. It is widely used in Kubernetes to define objects such as Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

Overview of This YAML File

This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment, which is responsible for managing a set of Pods running a containerized application. The Deployment ensures that the desired number of replicas are running and automatically handles updates and rollbacks.

Breakdown of the YAML File

1. API Version and Kind

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

apiVersion: Specifies the Kubernetes API version being used (apps/v1 for Deployments).

kind: Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (here, a Deployment).

2. Metadata

metadata:
  name: pod-info-deployment
  namespace: development
  labels:
    app: pod-info

name: Unique identifier for this Deployment (pod-info-deployment).

namespace: Defines the namespace in which this Deployment will be created (development).

labels: Key-value pairs used for organization and selection (app: pod-info). Labels are metadata that categorize and organize Kubernetes objects.

‚ö†Ô∏è Labels in metadata vs. Labels in template:

The labels inside metadata (at the Deployment level) apply to the Deployment itself. These labels help categorize and manage the Deployment as a resource.

The labels inside template.metadata apply to the Pods created by this Deployment. These labels ensure that the Pods are properly selected and managed by the Deployment.

3. Specifying the Deployment Specification

spec:
  replicas: 3

replicas: Specifies how many instances (Pods) of the application should be running (3).

4. Selector and Template

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pod-info

selector: Determines which Pods are managed by this Deployment. It selects Pods with the label app: pod-info.

matchLabels: Ensures that only Pods with the exact label app: pod-info are included in this Deployment. It acts as a filter to match specific Pods.

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pod-info

template: Defines the blueprint for the Pods that will be created.

labels: Ensures that the Pods created have the label app: pod-info.

üîó How Labels and matchLabels Work Together:

Labels are assigned to objects (like Pods) to categorize them.

matchLabels in a selector ensures that only the Pods with those specific labels are managed by the Deployment.

This means that the Deployment will only manage Pods that have the label app: pod-info.

5. Pod Specification

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pod-info-container
        image: kimschles/pod-info-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000

containers: Defines the containers running inside each Pod.

name: The name of the container (pod-info-container).

image: Specifies the container image to use (kimschles/pod-info-app:latest).

ports: Declares which ports should be exposed (3000).

6. Environment Variables

        env:
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: POD_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP

env: Defines environment variables available in the container.

POD_NAME: Retrieves the Pod's name dynamically.

POD_NAMESPACE: Retrieves the namespace in which the Pod is running.

POD_IP: Retrieves the Pod's IP address.

How This YAML is Used in Kubernetes

üöÄ Deploying the Application:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

This command applies the YAML file and creates the Deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.

üîç Checking the Status:

kubectl get deployments -n development

Displays information about the Deployment, including the number of running Pods.

üìú Viewing Logs of a Pod:

kubectl logs -f pod-info-deployment-xxxxx -n development

Allows debugging and monitoring of logs generated by the application inside the container.

Why is This Important?

üõ†Ô∏è Declarative Configuration: This YAML allows defining the desired state of an application in Kubernetes.

üìà Scalability: The replicas field ensures multiple instances of the application run for high availability.

üîÑ Self-Healing: Kubernetes restarts failed Pods automatically.

üåç Portability: This YAML file can be reused across different environments and clusters.

By understanding this YAML structure, Kubernetes users can efficiently manage and deploy containerized applications at scale. üöÄ
