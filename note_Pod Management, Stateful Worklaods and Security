# Kubernetes Pod Management, Stateful Workloads, and Security

## üß© Ways to Manage Kubernetes Pods

Kubernetes provides multiple ways to manage pods:

### 1. **Deployment**
- Most common method to deploy containerized apps.
- Controls number of replicas.
- Supports **rolling updates** (no-downtime upgrades).
- Automatically handles old and new versions of pods.

### 2. **DaemonSet**
- Ensures one copy of a pod runs **on every node**.
- Typically used for background agents like:
  - Node metric collectors
  - Logging agents

### 3. **Job**
- Runs one or more pods **until the task completes**.
- Ideal for **one-time** or **batch processing** tasks.
- Example: Generate test data in a CI environment.

## üíæ Running Stateful Workloads

Two approaches to handle persistent data in Kubernetes:

### 1. **External Database**
- Host a DB outside the cluster (e.g., Postgres).
- Use managed services like:
  - Azure SQL
  - Amazon RDS
  - Google Cloud SQL

### 2. **Persistent Volumes (PV)**
- Storage managed inside the Kubernetes cluster.
- Data **persists even if pods are deleted**.
- Use with `StatefulSet` to maintain pod-to-volume mapping.

## üîê Kubernetes Security Best Practices

Common attack goals:
- Steal data
- Run crypto mining
- Perform DDoS attacks

### 1. **Add Security Context**
Add the following to your pod spec:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  
```
### 2. **Scan YAML with Security Tools**
Use tools like Snyk to scan manifests:

```
snyk iac test deployment.yaml
```

### 3. **Keep Kubernetes Version Updated**

- Always upgrade when security patches are released.

- Follow Kubernetes CVE advisories.

- Reference the NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guide.
