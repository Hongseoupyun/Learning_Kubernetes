# Understanding Kubernetes: Namespace, Service, Deployment

1️⃣ Namespace 🏢

A Namespace in Kubernetes is a way to logically separate resources within a cluster. It helps manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) within the same Kubernetes cluster.

✨ Key Features

A cluster can have multiple namespaces.

Each namespace isolates its own resources (Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.).

You can have resources with the same name in different namespaces without conflicts.

📌 Example: Checking all Pods in the development namespace

kubectl get pods -n development  # List all Pods in the development namespace
kubectl create namespace my-namespace  # Create a new namespace

2️⃣ Service 🌐

A Service in Kubernetes provides a stable network endpoint for a group of Pods. Since Pod IPs can change, a Service ensures consistent access to the application.

✨ Key Features

Provides a fixed IP and DNS name to access dynamically changing Pods.

Supports different types such as ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

Ensures load balancing and routing across multiple Pods.

📌 Example: Creating a ClusterIP Service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: development
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app  # Targets Pods with this label
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Exposed port of the Service
      targetPort: 8080  # The port inside the Pod
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal access only

kubectl get svc -n development  # List all Services in the namespace

3️⃣ Deployment 🚀

A Deployment is responsible for managing and scaling a set of Pods running an application. It ensures a specified number of replicas are running and supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

✨ Key Features

Creates and maintains multiple Pods.

Ensures a desired number of replicas are always running.

Provides rolling updates and rollback functionality.

📌 Example: Creating a Deployment with 3 Pods

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  namespace: development
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Run 3 Pods
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app-container
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

kubectl get deployments -n development  # View Deployments
kubectl scale deployment my-app-deployment --replicas=5 -n development  # Scale the number of Pods
